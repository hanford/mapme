First download all of your data from google, you can do that [here](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout)

After you download it, grab ```LocationHistory.json```  

Clone this repo and drop the above file into this projects root directory

```npm install```  
```node index.js```

Then take the contents of locations.json and add them to the ```locationData``` variable in the ```index.html``` file.

I'll streamline this entire process in the next couple of weeks ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
